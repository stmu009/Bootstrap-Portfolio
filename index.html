                                    <p>Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon
                                        is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.</p>
                                    <p>That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this
                                        way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here!
                                        Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!</p>
                                    <p>Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need
                                        to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not
                                        the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your
                                        business. Move along. Move along. Move along.</p>
                                    <p>Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned
                                        up before dinner. But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
                                        You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get
                                        to it! All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.
                                        Uncle Owen... Yeah?This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what're you trying
                                        to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
                                        Uncle Owen... Yeah? What about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that
                                        one. Yeah, take it away.</p>
                                    <p>Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a
                                        transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel
                                        is right, of course.</p>
